# Java Command-Line Calculator

A simple, method-based calculator built with **Java** to practice static methods and user input handling.

## 🚀 Features
- **Four Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Method-Based Logic:** Each operation is encapsulated in its own static method.
- **Continuous Loop:** The program runs until the user types `stop`.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 11+
- **Input Handling:** `java.util.Scanner`

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. Compile the file: `javac Mane.java`
2. Run the program: `java Mane`
3. Type the operation (`plus`, `minus`, `multy`, `divide`) and then enter two integers.
4. Type `stop` to exit.

## 🎯 Learning Progress
This project is part of my transition from Python to Java, focusing on **strong typing** and **static methods**. It's another step towards my goal of a dual study program at **SAP**.
